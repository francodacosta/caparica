## How does it work
Request signing is a similar process to, for example, signing a bank cheque. Cheques include your name, details regarding who to pay and how much, and your signature. After matching your name and signature with your reference signature held by the bank, the instructions in the cheque will be processed.

Caparica works in the same way. We check your Client ID and compare the Signature in the request with the one generated by the Server. If they match, your request will be executed.

The request is signed this way:
  1. sort all parameters sent in the request
  2. produce a string in the form of ```param-1=value-1&...&param-N=value-N```
  3. create the signature by hasing the string using the secret code
  4. make the request to the server and pass the hash signature

The server will repeat the process and compare the signatures.

To avoid replay attacks you should include the current timestamp in the signature, Caparica can handle that for you
