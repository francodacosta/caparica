# Caparica Documentation


## Rationale
Request signing is a similar process to, for example, signing a bank cheque. Cheques include your name, details regarding who to pay and how much, and your signature. After matching your name and signature with your reference signature held by the bank, the instructions in the cheque will be processed.

Caparica works in the same way. We check your Client ID and compare the Signature in the request with the one generated by the Server. If they match, your request will be executed.
